# dotfiles
Some stuff I'd like to have if all my computers die today.

It's not recommended to use this repo as an example of how to manage dotfiles. I literally just dumped this stuff here so I can sleep at night. I've put very little thought into these dotfiles other than making them work for me with the base minimum effort.
